   <p style= "color:#004d00">Slytherin- <br>
The worst of them all the devils themselves, Slytherin, founded by the nasty man Salazar Slytherin they are represented by the devils creature the serpent. Just like the serpent they slide around causing mischief and breaking rules across the school with their cunning, and resourcefulness, they constantly put other students in harm's way endangering us all. Slytherin has nothing ever good about them constantly up to their secret ways and trying to deceive us.

  <p style="color:#006bb3">Ravenclaw- <br>
Founded by Rowena Ravenclaw with the tacky colors of blue and bronze -- which just don’t mix by the way -- they are represented by the eagle, just a regular eagle not even a raven like what?  Ravenclaw values those artsy little prissy things like individuality and creativity, which is nothing to the exciting life of Gryffindor with our strong values of daring and nerve. Ravenclaw can be dangerous though with their wit and wisdom which makes them tricky and admirable foes.

 <p style= "color:#e6b800">Hufflepuff- <br>
Founded by Helga Hufflepuff with the ugly bee like colors of yellow and black (ew why?) with the animal mascot of a badger. Why a badger am I right? They value boring things like patience, why need patience when we can go in and win it all right now! Hufflepuff is nice and all but they don’t value the strong honorable traits like bravery and chivalry. They do value loyalty and kindness on the other hand so there is something good to them at least.
