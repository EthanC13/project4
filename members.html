		<p>Harry Potter- <br> Harry Potter is a member of the Potter family, the same potter family that has consistently in the house of Gryffindor. Harry has been a model student doing well in his classes and is a great student in class with his work. He also represents a bold and brave Gryffindor student as he has recently taken down a teacher working for he who shall not be named, as well as defeated a basilisk hidden under our school working for the evil one, the one who shall not be named as well. Harry has competed in the quidditch games as well chasing after the golden snitch and has been an all around great student, truly resembling the Gryffindor house well.

        <img src="images/ron.jpg" alt="ron" style="width:50%" "height:50%;">
		 <p>Ronald Weasley- <br> Ronald Weasley, also known as Ron he has accompanied Harry Potter in all his journeys and is a good friend of Harry. The two go everywhere together and are in very similar classes, of course Ron isnâ€™t as intelligent or focussed as Harry. Ron may not be as focussed but he has been with Harry in his journeys against he who shall not be named. Ron has also joined Harry on the quidditch team and was a star keeper as he defended the goals flawlessly in one of the most important games. It is said he might have drank a potion beforehand that helped him but Harry assured there was no potion involved it was pure determination and talent. Ronald is known to be a fun guy and a jokester around campus he is a very enjoyable member of Gryffindor.

		<p>Hermione Granger- <br> Hermione Granger the third of the trio friend group that has been helping Gryffindor grow as the best house on campus. Ms. Hermione has been known to help Harry in his mysterious quests against he who shall not be named. She has constantly been there to solve puzzles and answer questions Ron and Harry cannot, she is the brain of the operation and very intelligent on her own. It is said she takes more classes than anyone and at one point she somehow took multiple classes during the same time of day! She literally aced two classes that go on at the same time! She found a way to be in two places at once! Hermione Granger represents the intellects of the house of Gryffindor, who are by far more intelligent than any other.
